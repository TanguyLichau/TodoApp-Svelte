# Todo App

This project is a basic Todo App, it is my first project using Svelte.

## Features

- See list of todos
- Create a todo
- Delete a todo
- Mark todo as completed
- Filter todos by status : all todos, active todos or completed todos
- Mark all todos as completed
- Unmark all completed todos
- Delete all completed todos

## Get started

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

Install the dependencies...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanguyLichau/TodoApp-Svelte.git
cd TodoApp-Svelte
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
